# FrontierML: Machine Learning with Real-World Data

Welcome to **FrontierML**, an interactive Jupyter Book that teaches machine learning concepts through hands-on implementation with real-world data collection and analysis.

## About This Book

This book provides a comprehensive introduction to machine learning algorithms, combining theoretical understanding with practical implementation. What sets this book apart is its emphasis on:

- **Real-world data collection** through web scraping and APIs
- **Step-by-step mathematical explanations** with proper citations
- **Interactive code examples** that you can run and modify
- **Comprehensive visualizations** to understand algorithm behavior
- **Best practices** for data science workflows

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this book, you will be able to:

1. **Collect and preprocess real-world data** from various sources
2. **Understand the mathematical foundations** of core ML algorithms
3. **Implement algorithms from scratch** using Python and NumPy
4. **Apply scikit-learn** for production-ready implementations
5. **Evaluate and compare** different machine learning models
6. **Visualize results** effectively for communication and analysis

## Prerequisites

This book assumes familiarity with:
- Basic Python programming
- Fundamental mathematics (algebra, calculus basics)
- Basic statistics concepts
