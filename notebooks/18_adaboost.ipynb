    "## Learning Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "In this chapter, you will learn:\n",
    "- **Mathematical foundations** of adaptive boosting algorithm\n",
    "- **Weight update mechanisms** and error-based learning\n",
    "- **Weak learner combination** strategies\n",
    "- **Implementation** from scratch using decision stumps\n",

    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "AdaBoost (Adaptive Boosting) combines multiple weak learners by focusing on previously misclassified examples, creating a strong classifier through weighted voting.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Mathematical Foundation**: AdaBoost minimizes an exponential loss function by sequentially adding weak learners and adaptively adjusting training example weights.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Mathematical Theory\n",
    "\n",
    "### Algorithm Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "For iteration $t$:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Train weak learner**: $h_t$ with weighted training set\n",
    "2. **Calculate error**: $\\epsilon_t = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} w_i^{(t)} \\mathbb{I}[h_t(x_i) \\neq y_i]$\n",
    "3. **Compute alpha**: $\\alpha_t = \\frac{1}{2} \\ln\\left(\\frac{1-\\epsilon_t}{\\epsilon_t}\\right)$\n",
    "4. **Update weights**: $w_i^{(t+1)} = w_i^{(t)} \\exp(-\\alpha_t y_i h_t(x_i))$\n",
    "\n",
    "### Final Classifier\n",
    "\n",
    "$$H(x) = \\text{sign}\\left(\\sum_{t=1}^{T} \\alpha_t h_t(x)\\right)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "**Citation**: AdaBoost theory and analysis are covered in ensemble learning and computational learning theory literature."
