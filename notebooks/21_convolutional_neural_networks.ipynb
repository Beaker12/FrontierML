    "# Chapter 21: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Learning Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "In this chapter, you will learn:\n",
    "- **Mathematical foundations** of convolution and pooling operations\n",
    "- **CNN architectures** including LeNet, AlexNet, and ResNet concepts\n",
    "- **Feature maps and filters** for image pattern recognition\n",
    "- **Implementation** using TensorFlow/Keras\n",
    "- **Applications** in computer vision and image classification\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are specialized neural networks for processing grid-like data such as images, using convolution operations to detect local features.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Mathematical Foundation**: CNNs apply convolution operations that preserve spatial relationships while learning translation-invariant features through shared weights and local connectivity.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Mathematical Theory\n",
    "\n",
    "### Convolution Operation\n",
    "\n",
    "For 2D convolution:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$(I * K)(i,j) = \\sum_{m} \\sum_{n} I(i-m, j-n) K(m,n)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Where:\n",
    "- $I$ is the input image\n",
    "- $K$ is the kernel (filter)\n",
    "- $(i,j)$ are spatial coordinates\n",
    "\n",
    "### Feature Map Computation\n",
    "\n",
    "Each feature map is computed as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$y_{i,j}^{(l)} = \\sigma\\left(\\sum_{k} w_k^{(l)} * x^{(l-1)} + b^{(l)}\\right)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Where:\n",
    "- $l$ denotes the layer\n",
    "- $w_k^{(l)}$ are the learned filters\n",
    "- $b^{(l)}$ is the bias term\n",
    "- $\\sigma$ is the activation function\n",
    "\n",
    "**Citation**: Convolutional neural networks and their mathematical foundations are covered in deep learning literature."
