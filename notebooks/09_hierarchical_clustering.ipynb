    "# Chapter 9: Hierarchical Clustering\n",
    "\n",
    "## Learning Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "In this chapter, you will learn:\n",
    "- **Mathematical foundations** of agglomerative and divisive clustering\n",
    "- **Linkage criteria** and distance metrics\n",
    "- **Dendrogram interpretation** and cluster selection\n",
    "- **Implementation** from scratch and with Scikit-learn\n",
    "- **Comparison** with other clustering methods\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Hierarchical clustering creates tree-like cluster structures without requiring the number of clusters to be specified in advance. It builds nested partitions that can reveal cluster structures at multiple scales.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Mathematical Foundation**: Hierarchical clustering uses various linkage criteria to measure distances between clusters, creating a hierarchy that can be visualized as a dendrogram.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Mathematical Theory\n",
    "\n",
    "### Linkage Criteria\n",
    "\n",
    "Different linkage methods define cluster distance:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Single linkage**: $d(C_i, C_j) = \\min_{x \\in C_i, y \\in C_j} d(x, y)$\n",
    "- **Complete linkage**: $d(C_i, C_j) = \\max_{x \\in C_i, y \\in C_j} d(x, y)$\n",
    "- **Average linkage**: $d(C_i, C_j) = \\frac{1}{|C_i||C_j|} \\sum_{x \\in C_i} \\sum_{y \\in C_j} d(x, y)$\n",
    "\n",
    "**Citation**: Comprehensive coverage of hierarchical clustering methods can be found in standard clustering literature."
