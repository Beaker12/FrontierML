    "# Chapter 20: Autoencoders (Deep Learning)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Learning Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "In this chapter, you will learn:\n",
    "- **Mathematical foundations** of encoder-decoder architectures\n",
    "- **Dimensionality reduction** and feature learning\n",
    "- **Variational autoencoders** and regularization techniques\n",
    "- **Implementation** using TensorFlow/Keras\n",
    "- **Applications** in anomaly detection and generative modeling\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Autoencoders are neural networks that learn efficient data representations by training to reconstruct their inputs through a compressed hidden layer representation.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Mathematical Foundation**: Autoencoders minimize reconstruction error by learning optimal encoder and decoder functions that map data to a lower-dimensional latent space and back.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Mathematical Theory\n",
    "\n",
    "### Architecture\n",
    "\n",
    "An autoencoder consists of:\n",
    "- **Encoder**: $z = f(x)$ where $z \\in \\mathbb{R}^d$ and $d < \\text{input dimension}$\n",
    "- **Decoder**: $\\hat{x} = g(z)$ where $\\hat{x}$ approximates $x$\n",
    "\n",
    "### Loss Function\n",
    "\n",
    "**Reconstruction loss**: $L(x, \\hat{x}) = ||x - \\hat{x}||^2$\n",
    "\n",
    "For variational autoencoders, add regularization:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$L_{VAE} = L_{reconstruction} + \\beta \\cdot KL(q(z|x) || p(z))$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Where:\n",
    "- $q(z|x)$ is the encoder distribution\n",
    "- $p(z)$ is the prior distribution (typically $\\mathcal{N}(0, I)$)\n",
    "- $\\beta$ controls the regularization strength\n",
    "\n",
    "**Citation**: Autoencoder architectures and variational inference are covered in deep learning literature."
